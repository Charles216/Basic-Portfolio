        <p>
          This is one of the first but many projects that I under take here in this Boot Camp. 
          I am really excited for this new challenge and am looking forward to absorbing every bit of
          info that I can. So far my favorite parts have been just figuring out how to make something work. 
          Watching my creation come to life on the screen is actually really cool to see.
        <br>
        <br>
          I am also really enjoying the thrill of seeing how it all works. I mean the nuts and bolts of building a website.
          Understanding why something is reacting the way that it is - or hell not Understanding why something is happening,
          that can even cooler because that leads to discovery and what is more cool than discovering something new?! I mean 
          really at this point learning a small thing gets me going.
        <br>
        <br>
          I am looking for ward to adding to this little bio with all of the skills that I am learning. I want to show future 
          employers how driven I am. I want to prove to people that I can hand stressful situations, that I can learn new material, 
          and that I have a serious ambition to be successful in this field. I know that I will feel like an imposter for the first 
          few months  to a year. But ultimately I am confident that this will all become second nature to me. I am very excited for this
          journey!
